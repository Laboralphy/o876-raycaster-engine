# The blueprints.json format
## To start with
The __blueprints.json__ file is completed at runtime using the __ghosts.json__ content
which contains all game play data including thinker, speed, level, score...

The blueprints are all completed with the "ref" field, which will be identical as "id".

Remember : The "ref" field is used to identify blueprints when id is automatically generated (md5)
